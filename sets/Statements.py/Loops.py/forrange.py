## range
## the range function in python is used to generate a sequence of number . We can also specify start , stop , and step-size.

# for b in range (10):
#     print(b)
# for b in range (1, 8)
# print(b)

# for b in range(1, 10,2):
#     print(b)

# for b in range(8,1,-1):
#     print(b)


adj = ["red","big"]
fruirs = ["apple","banana"]
c = ["ap","bp"]
for x in adj:
    for y in fruirs:
        for z in c:
            print(x,y,z)


# for variable_1 in range (5,1,-1): ## it will print 
#     print("e")

# for variable_1 in range (1,5,-1): ## it will not print anything because it does not goes in descending order
#     print("e")
